Thanks
------

Thanks goes out to everyone who has helped out with TikaOnDotnet.

- All [project contributors](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet/graphs/contributors).

- Sergey Tihon - who opened up the license of his [build automation](https://github.com/sergey-tihon/Stanford.NLP.NET/blob/3cef796a872c59448de345ad8bd72ceb04920b7d/build.fsx)
so we could remove that nasty manual `ikvmc.exe` step.
